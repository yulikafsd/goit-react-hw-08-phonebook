React components: at Lazy - at RenderedRoute. Consider adding an error boundary

Uncaught Error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input.
This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates
that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition at throwException - at
handleError.
