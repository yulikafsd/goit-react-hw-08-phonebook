[Error](https://prnt.sc/5Q643fWEfD2W) The above error occurred in one of your
React components: at Lazy - at RenderedRoute. Consider adding an error boundary
to your tree to customize error handling behavior. Visit
https://reactjs.org/link/error-boundaries to learn more about error boundaries.
Uncaught Error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input.
This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates
that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition at throwException - at
handleError.
